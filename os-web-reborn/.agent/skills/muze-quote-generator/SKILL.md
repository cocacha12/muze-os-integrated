# Muze Quote Generator

This skill defines the standard and logic for generating commercial proposals within Muze OS.

## 1. Goal
Provide a consistent, high-fidelity structure for project quotes, ensuring all necessary business terms (pricing, deliverables, HES/HE requirements for Cermaq) are included.

## 2. Proposal Structure
Every quote generated by this skill must follow this Markdown structure:

### [Proposal ID: Q-YYYYMMDD-XXXX]
**Project**: {Project Name}
**Client**: {Customer Name}
**Date**: {Current Date}

---

### Executive Summary
{A concise 2-sentence description of the value proposition.}

### Objectives & Deliverables
- **Objective 1**: {Description}
- **Objective 2**: {Description}
- ...

### Commercial Terms
- **Net Amount**: {Amount} CLP
- **IVA (19%)**: {Calculated IVA} CLP
- **Total Amount**: {Total} CLP
- **Payment Terms**: {e.g., 30 days post-invoice}

### Specific Requirements (Cermaq)
- **HES/HE Code**: Required before invoicing.
- **Reference**: {e.g., OC # if available}

---

## 3. Agent Instructions
- **Phase 1: Discovery**: Read project details from `/api/projects/{projectId}`.
- **Phase 2: Drafting**: Use the template above. Ensure the tone is professional and "agentic" (efficient, clear).
- **Phase 3: Registration**: Submit the generated quote text to the `/api/quotes` endpoint in Muze OS.

## 4. Verification
- [ ] Is the IVA calculation correct? (Amount * 0.19)
- [ ] Does it include the correct Proposal ID format?
- [ ] For Cermaq, are the HES/HE requirements explicitly mentioned?
